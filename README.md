- Practice scenario where there is a discrepancy in the financials, but I only know it happened between 2011 and 2012. I am looking to see if I can pinpoint a reason or prospect for the cause.  
- Displays use of SQL queries such as **INNER JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, SUM, AVG, COUNT, ORDER BY, AND, and strftime**. I also showcased the use of subqueries.
