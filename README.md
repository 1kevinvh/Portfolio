## My Approach to Data Analysis: 
I begin every project by framing the business question, ensuring I understand the core issue at hand. Then, I prepare the data through cleaning and organization, followed by detailed analysis. Once the insights are discovered, I interpret the findings and communicate the results in a clear, actionable format. This structured approach allows me to deliver impactful, data-driven solutions.

## Why Data Analysis? 
Initially unsure of my career path after graduation, I discovered my passion for data when I started using Excel to manage business information. The power of making informed, data-driven decisions, as opposed to relying on gut instinct, is what excites me the most about this field. It feels incredibly rewarding to see how data can drive positive change and improve efficiency.
